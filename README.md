# Comprehensive-Analysis-of-Pizza-Sales-Data
I recently completed a data analysis project by using sql focusing on the pizza sales of a fictional pizza restaurant. The project involved analyzing various datasets to gain insights into sales performance, customer preferences, and operational efficiency. The project comprised several key components:

Datasets Used:

Pizzas: Detailed information about different types of pizzas available, including names, sizes, and descriptions.
Pizza Types: Categories and specific attributes of the pizzas, such as ingredients and variations.
Orders: Data on individual orders, including order IDs, customer information, and timestamps.
Order Details: Detailed breakdowns of each order, including the specific pizzas ordered, quantities, and prices.

Objectives:

To analyze sales trends and identify the most popular pizzas.
To examine customer ordering patterns and peak order times.
To evaluate the performance of different pizza types and sizes.
To provide actionable insights for improving menu offerings and marketing strategies.

Key Analysis and Techniques:

Data Cleaning and Preparation: Ensured data integrity by handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.
Descriptive Statistics: Summarized key metrics such as total sales, average order value, and frequency of orders.

Tools and Technologies:


SQL: For querying and managing relational databases.

Results and Insights:

Identified the top-selling pizzas and the least popular ones, providing recommendations for menu optimization.
Recognized peak ordering times, enabling better staffing and resource management.
Discovered key customer segments and their preferences, aiding targeted marketing efforts.
This project not only enhanced my data analysis skills but also provided valuable insights into the operations of a pizza restaurant, demonstrating the power of data-driven decision-making in the food and beverage industry.
